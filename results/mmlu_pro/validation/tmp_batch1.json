The rate of change of salt in the tank is given by the difference between the rate at which salt enters the tank and the rate at which it leaves.\n\n1. **Rate in**: The incoming solution has a concentration of 0.02 grams per liter and flows in at 4 liters per minute. So, the rate of salt entering the tank is:\n   $$\n   \\text{Rate in} = 0.02 \\, \\text{g/L} \\times 4 \\, \\text{L/min} = 0.08 \\, \\text{g/min}\n   $$\n\n2. **Rate out**: The solution is well-mixed, so the concentration of salt in the tank at time $ t $ is $ \\frac{S(t)}{100} $ grams per liter (since the volume remains constant at 100 liters).
