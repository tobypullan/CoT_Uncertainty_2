      "baseline_cot_response_raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the greatest negative number in the set B, which consists of all m + n where (m, n) are integer solutions to the equation 7m + 12n = 22. The options are from A to J, with various negative numbers and N/A.\n\nFirst, I need to find all integer solutions (m, n) to the equation 7m + 12n = 22. Then, for each solution, compute m + n and find the greatest negative value among them. The greatest negative number would be the one closest to zero, like -1 is greater than -2, etc.\n\nSo, starting with solving the Diophantine equation 7m + 12n = 22. Since 7 and 12 are coefficients, their greatest common divisor is 1, which divides 22, so there are solutions.\n\nFirst, find one particular solution. Let me try to find integers m and n such that 7m + 12n = 22. Maybe I can use the extended Euclidean algorithm, but maybe trial and error would work here.\n\nLet me try small values for m or n. Let's suppose m is 0. Then 12n = 22 → n = 22/12 = 11/6, not integer. If n=0, 7m=22 → m=22/7, not integer. So neither m nor n can be zero here.\n\nLet me try m=2: 7*2=14, so 12n=22-14=8 → n=8/12=2/3. Not integer. m=4: 7*4=28, 12n=22-28=-6 → n=-6/12=-0.5. Not integer. m=1: 7*1=7, 12n=15 → n=15/12=5/4. No. m= -1: 7*(-1) = -7, 12n=22 +7=29 → n=29/12. Not integer. m= -2: 7*(-2)=-14, 12n=22+14=36 → n=3. So n=3. So when m=-2, n=3. Let's check: 7*(-2) +12*3= -14 +36=22. Yes! So one particular solution is m=-2, n=3. Then m + n is -2 +3=1. But we need the greatest negative number in B, so maybe there are other solutions where m + n is negative.\n\nNow, the general solution for the Diophantine equation. Since the equation is 7m +12n=22, and we have a particular solution (m0, n0)=(-2, 3). The general solution can be found by considering that the homogeneous equation 7m +12n=0 has solutions where 7m = -12n, so m = -12k, n=7k for integer k. Therefore, the general solution is m = -2 -12k, n=3 +7k for integer k. Wait, let me check that. Because the coefficients are 7 and 12, the general solution should be the particular solution plus the homogeneous solution. So if the homogeneous solutions are multiples of ( -12, 7 ), then adding that to the particular solution. So yes, m = -2 -12k, n=3 +7k. Let me verify with k=0: m=-2, n=3. For k=1: m=-2-12= -14, n=3+7=10. Check 7*(-14) +12*10= -98 +120=22. Correct. For k=-1: m=-2 +12=10, n=3-7=-4. Check 7*10 +12*(-4)=70 -48=22. Correct. So the general solution is m = -2 -12k, n=3 +7k, where k is any integer.\n\nNow, B is the set {m + n | (m,n) in A}. So m + n = (-2 -12k) + (3 +7k) = (-2 +3) + (-12k +7k) = 1 -5k. Therefore, B is the set {1 -5k | k ∈ ℤ}. So we need to find the greatest negative number in this set. The elements of B are 1 -5k for integers k. So we need to find the maximum value of 1 -5k that is negative. So 1 -5k < 0 → -5k < -1 → 5k > 1 → k ≥ 1 (since k is integer). Wait, solving 1 -5k < 0: subtract 1: -5k < -1 → multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality): 5k > 1 → k > 1/5. Since k is integer, k ≥ 1. Therefore, for k ≥ 1, 1 -5k is negative. The values for k=1: 1 -5(1)= -4. For k=2: 1 -10= -9. For k=3: -14, etc. So as k increases, the value decreases. Therefore, the maximum (greatest) negative number in this part is -4 (when k=1). But wait, what about k=0? For k=0, 1 -0=1, which is positive. For k negative? Let's check. For example, k=-1: 1 -5*(-1)=1 +5=6. Positive. So the negative numbers in B come only from k ≥1. So the maximum negative is -4. But let me check if there are other possibilities. Wait, but maybe there are other solutions? Wait, no, because we derived the general solution as m = -2 -12k, n=3 +7k. So all solutions are covered by varying k over integers. Therefore, B is exactly {1 -5k | k ∈ ℤ}. Therefore, the negative numbers in B are -4, -9, -14,... So the greatest is -4. But wait, the options include -4 as option E. But let me check if there are other solutions where m + n is negative but not captured here? No, because we have the general solution. Therefore, the answer should be -4, which is option E. But wait, let me check again. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest negative number\". So -4 is greater than -5, -6, etc. So if -4 is in the set, then it's the maximum. But let me check if there are other solutions where m + n is between 0 and -4? For example, maybe -1, -2, -3? But according to our general solution, B is {1 -5k | k integer}. So possible values are ... when k=0:1, k=1:-4, k=2:-9, etc. For negative k: k=-1: 1 +5=6, k=-2: 1 +10=11, etc. So there are no other values. Therefore, the only negative numbers in B are -4, -9, -14,... So the greatest is -4. Therefore, the answer is E. But wait, let me check if there are other solutions outside of the general solution we found. For example, sometimes when solving Diophantine equations, there might be different forms of the general solution. Let me confirm. The equation is 7m +12n=22. The general solution for ax + by = c is found by taking a particular solution and adding the homogeneous solutions. The homogeneous equation is 7m +12n=0. The solutions to that are multiples of ( -12, 7 ), since 7*(-12) +12*7= -84 +84=0. Therefore, the general solution is indeed (m0 -12k, n0 +7k). So our general solution is correct. Therefore, m + n is 1 -5k. Therefore, the only negative numbers in B are when k ≥1, giving -4, -9,... So the maximum is -4. Therefore, the answer is E. But let me check the options again. The options are A. -5, B.0, C.-3, D.-7, E.-4, F.-6, G.-1, H.-2, I.-9, J.N/A. So E is -4. Therefore, the answer is E. But wait, let me check if there's a mistake in my reasoning. For example, maybe there's another particular solution that leads to different general solutions? Let me try to find another particular solution. Suppose I take n=1. Then 7m +12*1=22 →7m=10 →m=10/7, not integer. n=2: 7m +24=22 →7m=-2 →m=-2/7. No. n=-1: 7m -12=22 →7m=34 →m=34/7. No. n= -2: 7m -24=22 →7m=46 →m=46/7. No. So the only particular solution I found was m=-2, n=3. So that's correct. Therefore, the general solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is E. -4. But let me check if there's a case where m + n is negative but not captured by this. For example, if there's another way to express the solutions. Suppose I solve for m in terms of n. 7m =22 -12n → m=(22 -12n)/7. For m to be integer, 22 -12n must be divisible by 7. So 22 ≡ 12n mod7. Since 12 mod7 is 5, so 1 ≡5n mod7. Therefore, 5n ≡1 mod7. Multiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod7. The inverse of 5 mod7 is 3 because 5*3=15≡1 mod7. Therefore, n≡3*1=3 mod7. Therefore, n=3 +7k for integer k. Then m=(22 -12n)/7. Substitute n=3 +7k: m=(22 -12*(3 +7k))/7 = (22 -36 -84k)/7 = (-14 -84k)/7 = -2 -12k. Which is the same as before. Therefore, m=-2 -12k, n=3 +7k. Therefore, m +n=1 -5k. So same result. Therefore, the conclusion is correct. Therefore, the greatest negative number is -4. So the answer is E.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we are given the Diophantine equation:\n\n$$\n7m + 12n = 22\n$$\n\nWe are to find the **greatest negative number** in the set:\n\n$$\nB = \\{ m + n : (m, n) \\in A \\}\n$$\n\nwhere $ A $ is the set of all integer solutions to the equation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Find a Particular Solution\n\nWe first find a particular solution to the equation.

      "baseline_cot_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Let's suppose m is 0. Then 12n = 22 → n = 22/12 = 11/6, not integer. If n=0, 7m=22 → m=22/7, not integer. So neither m nor n can be zero here.\n\nLet me try m=2: 7*2=14, so 12n=22-14=8 → n=8/12=2/3. Not integer. m=4: 7*4=28, 12n=22-28=-6 → n=-6/12=-0.5. Not integer. m=1: 7*1=7, 12n=15 → n=15/12=5/4. No. m= -1: 7*(-1) = -7, 12n=22 +7=29 → n=29/12. Not integer. m= -2: 7*(-2)=-14, 12n=22+14=36 → n=3. So n=3. So when m=-2, n=3. Let's check: 7*(-2) +12*3= -14 +36=22. Yes! So one particular solution is m=-2, n=3. Then m + n is -2 +3=1. But we need the greatest negative number in B, so maybe there are other solutions where m + n is negative.\n\nNow, the general solution for the Diophantine equation. Since the equation is 7m +12n=22, and we have a particular solution (m0, n0)=(-2, 3). The general solution can be found by considering that the homogeneous equation 7m +12n=0 has solutions where 7m = -12n, so m = -12k, n=7k for integer k. Therefore, the general solution is m = -2 -12k, n=3 +7k for integer k. Wait, let me check that. Because the coefficients are 7 and 12, the general solution should be the particular solution plus the homogeneous solution. So if the homogeneous solutions are multiples of ( -12, 7 ), then adding that to the particular solution. So yes, m = -2 -12k, n=3 +7k. Let me verify with k=0: m=-2, n=3. For k=1: m=-2-12= -14, n=3+7=10. Check 7*(-14) +12*10= -98 +120=22. Correct. For k=-1: m=-2 +12=10, n=3-7=-4. Check 7*10 +12*(-4)=70 -48=22. Correct. So the general solution is m = -2 -12k, n=3 +7k, where k is any integer.\n\nNow, B is the set {m + n | (m,n) in A}. So m + n = (-2 -12k) + (3 +7k) = (-2 +3) + (-12k +7k) = 1 -5k. Therefore, B is the set {1 -5k | k ∈ ℤ}. So we need to find the greatest negative number in this set. The elements of B are 1 -5k for integers k. So we need to find the maximum value of 1 -5k that is negative. So 1 -5k < 0 → -5k < -1 → 5k > 1 → k ≥ 1 (since k is integer). Wait, solving 1 -5k < 0: subtract 1: -5k < -1 → multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality): 5k > 1 → k > 1/5. Since k is integer, k ≥ 1. Therefore, for k ≥ 1, 1 -5k is negative. The values for k=1: 1 -5(1)= -4. For k=2: 1 -10= -9. For k=3: -14, etc. So as k increases, the value decreases. Therefore, the maximum (greatest) negative number in this part is -4 (when k=1). But wait, what about k=0? For k=0, 1 -0=1, which is positive. For k negative? Let's check. For example, k=-1: 1 -5*(-1)=1 +5=6. Positive. So the negative numbers in B come only from k ≥1. So the maximum negative is -4. But let me check if there are other possibilities. Wait, but maybe there are other solutions? Wait, no, because we derived the general solution as m = -2 -12k, n=3 +7k. So all solutions are covered by varying k over integers. Therefore, B is exactly {1 -5k | k ∈ ℤ}. Therefore, the negative numbers in B are -4, -9, -14,... So the greatest is -4. But wait, the options include -4 as option E. But let me check if there are other solutions where m + n is negative but not captured here? No, because we have the general solution. Therefore, the answer should be -4, which is option E. But wait, let me check again. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest negative number\". So -4 is greater than -5, -6, etc. So if -4 is in the set, then it's the maximum. But let me check if there are other solutions where m + n is between 0 and -4? For example, maybe -1, -2, -3? But according to our general solution, B is {1 -5k | k integer}. So possible values are ... when k=0:1, k=1:-4, k=2:-9, etc. For negative k: k=-1: 1 +5=6, k=-2: 1 +10=11, etc. So there are no other values. Therefore, the only negative numbers in B are -4, -9, -14,... So the greatest is -4. Therefore, the answer is E. But wait, let me check if there are other solutions outside of the general solution we found. For example, sometimes when solving Diophantine equations, there might be different forms of the general solution. Let me confirm. The equation is 7m +12n=22. The general solution for ax + by = c is found by taking a particular solution and adding the homogeneous solutions. The homogeneous equation is 7m +12n=0. The solutions to that are multiples of ( -12, 7 ), since 7*(-12) +12*7= -84 +84=0. Therefore, the general solution is indeed (m0 -12k, n0 +7k). So our general solution is correct. Therefore, m + n is 1 -5k. Therefore, the only negative numbers in B are when k ≥1, giving -4, -9,... So the maximum is -4. Therefore, the answer is E. But let me check the options again. The options are A. -5, B.0, C.-3, D.-7, E.-4, F.-6, G.-1, H.-2, I.-9, J.N/A. So E is -4. Therefore, the answer is E. But wait, let me check if there's a mistake in my reasoning. For example, maybe there's another particular solution that leads to different general solutions? Let me try to find another particular solution. Suppose I take n=1. Then 7m +12*1=22 →7m=10 →m=10/7, not integer. n=2: 7m +24=22 →7m=-2 →m=-2/7. No. n=-1: 7m -12=22 →7m=34 →m=34/7. No. n= -2: 7m -24=22 →7m=46 →m=46/7. No. So the only particular solution I found was m=-2, n=3. So that's correct. Therefore, the general solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is E. -4.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod7. The inverse of 5 mod7 is 3 because 5*3=15≡1 mod7. Therefore, n≡3*1=3 mod7. Therefore, n=3 +7k for integer k. Then m=(22 -12n)/7. Substitute n=3 +7k: m=(22 -12*(3 +7k))/7 = (22 -36 -84k)/7 = (-14 -84k)/7 = -2 -12k. Which is the same as before. Therefore, m=-2 -12k, n=3 +7k. Therefore, m +n=1 -5k. So same result. Therefore, the conclusion is correct. Therefore, the greatest negative number is -4.

      "baseline_cot_response_raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a tank with some salt solution. Initially, there's 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water. Then, a salt solution with 0.02 grams per liter is being sprayed in at 4 liters per minute. The mixture is kept uniform, and it's flowing out at the same rate, 4 liters per minute. We need to find how much salt is in the tank after 100 minutes.\n\nFirst, this sounds like a differential equations problem, specifically a mixing problem. The key here is to model the rate of change of the amount of salt in the tank over time. Let me recall the general approach for these types of problems.\n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (let's call it S(t)) is equal to the rate at which salt is entering minus the rate at which it's leaving. \n\nSo, the inflow rate of salt is straightforward. The incoming solution has 0.02 grams per liter and flows in at 4 liters per minute. So, the rate in is 0.02 * 4 = 0.08 grams per minute.\n\nNow, the outflow rate depends on the concentration of salt in the tank at time t. Since the volume of the solution in the tank remains constant (because inflow and outflow rates are equal, both 4 L/min), the volume stays at 100 liters. Therefore, the concentration of salt in the tank at time t is S(t)/100 grams per liter. The outflow rate is then this concentration multiplied by the outflow rate of 4 L/min. So, the rate out is (S(t)/100) * 4 = (4/100) S(t) = 0.04 S(t) grams per minute.\n\nTherefore, the differential equation is:\n\ndS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t)\n\nThis is a linear first-order differential equation. Let me write it in standard form:\n\ndS/dt + 0.04 S(t) = 0.08\n\nTo solve this, I can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫0.04 dt) = e^(0.04t). Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(0.04t) dS/dt + 0.04 e^(0.04t) S(t) = 0.08 e^(0.04t)\n\nThe left side is the derivative of [S(t) e^(0.04t)] with respect to t. So integrating both sides:\n\n∫ d/dt [S(t) e^(0.04t)] dt = ∫ 0.08 e^(0.04t) dt\n\nIntegrating the right side:\n\nLet me compute the integral of 0.08 e^(0.04t) dt. Let u = 0.04t, then du = 0.04 dt, so dt = du/0.04. Therefore, the integral becomes 0.08 ∫ e^u * (du/0.04) = (0.08 / 0.04) ∫ e^u du = 2 e^u + C = 2 e^(0.04t) + C.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nS(t) e^(0.04t) = 2 e^(0.04t) + C\n\nDivide both sides by e^(0.04t):\n\nS(t) = 2 + C e^(-0.04t)\n\nNow apply the initial condition. At t=0, S(0) = 3 grams. So:\n\n3 = 2 + C e^(0) => 3 = 2 + C => C = 1.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nS(t) = 2 + e^(-0.04t)\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount after 100 minutes. Let's plug t=100 into this equation:\n\nS(100) = 2 + e^(-0.04 * 100) = 2 + e^(-4)\n\nLooking at the options, let's check the choices. Option I is 2 + e^-4. But wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, the differential equation was dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t). The integrating factor approach seems correct. The integrating factor is e^(∫0.04 dt) = e^(0.04t). Then multiplying through:\n\nd/dt [S(t) e^(0.04t)] = 0.08 e^(0.04t). Integrating both sides gives S(t) e^(0.04t) = (0.08 / 0.04) e^(0.04t) + C. Which is 2 e^(0.04t) + C. Then dividing by e^(0.04t) gives S(t) = 2 + C e^(-0.04t). Initial condition S(0)=3 gives 3=2 + C => C=1. So S(t)=2 + e^(-0.04t). At t=100, S(100)=2 + e^(-4). So that's option I. But let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 3 + e^-2\n\nB. 2 - e^-4\n\nC. 2 - e^-2\n\nD. 3 + e^-4\n\nE. 2 + e^-3\n\nF. 2 - e^-3\n\nG. 3 - e^-2\n\nH. 2 + e^-2\n\nI. 2 + e^-4\n\nJ. 2\n\nSo according to my calculation, the answer is I. But let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when solving the differential equation. Let me re-express the differential equation.\n\nOriginal equation: dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t). So rearranged as dS/dt + 0.04 S(t) = 0.08. That's correct. The integrating factor is e^(∫0.04 dt) = e^(0.04t). Multiply both sides:\n\ne^(0.04t) dS/dt + 0.04 e^(0.04t) S(t) = 0.08 e^(0.04t). The left side is d/dt [S(t) e^(0.04t)]. Integrate both sides:\n\nS(t) e^(0.04t) = ∫0.08 e^(0.04t) dt + C. The integral of 0.08 e^(0.04t) dt is (0.08 / 0.04) e^(0.04t) + C = 2 e^(0.04t) + C. Therefore, S(t) = 2 + C e^(-0.04t). Initial condition S(0)=3 gives C=1. So S(t)=2 + e^(-0.04t). At t=100, S(100)=2 + e^(-4). So that's option I. But let me check if the exponent is correct. The rate out was 0.04 S(t), which came from 4/100 = 0.04. Yes, that's correct. The inflow rate is 0.02 g/L * 4 L/min = 0.08 g/min. So the differential equation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be I. But let me check the options again. Option I is 2 + e^-4. Yes. So the answer is I. But wait, let me check if there's a miscalculation in the exponent. The exponent is -0.04*100 = -4. So e^-4. So yes, 2 + e^-4. So option I. But let me check if the problem is perhaps in another form. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the differential equation. Let me think again.\n\nThe rate of change of salt is inflow minus outflow. Inflow is 0.02 g/L * 4 L/min = 0.08 g/min. Outflow is (S(t)/100 L) * 4 L/min = 0.04 S(t) g/min. So dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t). Correct. So the differential equation is correct. The solution is S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04t}. At t=100, S(100)=2 + e^{-4}. So option I. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nI. 2 + e^-4\n\nYes. So the answer is I. But wait, the options given in the problem are labeled from A to J. Let me check again. The user provided the options as:\n\nOptions:\nA. 3 + e^-2\nB. 2 - e^-4\nC. 2 - e^-2\nD. 3 + e^-4\nE. 2 + e^-3\nF. 2 - e^-3\nG. 3 - e^-2\nH. 2 + e^-2\nI. 2 + e^-4\nJ. 2\n\nYes, option I is 2 + e^-4. Therefore, the answer is I. But let me check if there's a mistake in the sign when solving for the integrating factor. Wait, the integrating factor method is correct. The solution seems correct. Therefore, the answer is I. But let me check if the problem is perhaps different. For example, maybe the volume is changing? Wait, the problem says the mixture flows out at 4 liters per minute, same as inflow. So the volume remains 100 liters. So the concentration is S(t)/100. So the outflow rate is correct. Therefore, the answer is I. So the correct option is I.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes, we model the situation using a **first-order linear differential equation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Variables**\n\nLet $ S(t) $ be the amount of salt (in grams) in the tank at time $ t $ (in minutes).\n\n- **Initial condition**: $ S(0) = 3 $ grams\n- **Inflow rate**: 4 liters/min of a solution with 0.02 g/L → $ 0.02 \\times 4 = 0.08 $ g/min\n- **Outflow rate**: 4 liters/min of the well-mixed solution.

So the outflow of salt is $ \\frac{S(t)}{100} \\times 4 = 0.04 S(t) $ g/min\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up the Differential Equation**\n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\text{inflow rate} - \\text{outflow rate} = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t)\n$$\n\nThis is a **linear first-order differential equation**:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} + 0.04 S(t) = 0.08\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solve the Differential Equation**\n\nUse an integrating factor:\n\n$$\n\\mu(t) = e^{\\int 0.04 \\, dt} = e^{0.04t}\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides of the equation by $ e^{0.04t} $:\n\n$$\ne^{0.04t} \\frac{dS}{dt} + 0.04 e^{0.04t} S(t) = 0.08 e^{0.04t}\n$$\n\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of $ S(t) e^{0.04t} $:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( S(t) e^{0.04t} \\right) = 0.08 e^{0.04t}\n$$\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n$$\nS(t) e^{0.04t} = \\int 0.08 e^{0.04t} dt = 2 e^{0.04t} + C\n$$\n\nSolve for $ S(t) $:\n\n$$\nS(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04t}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Apply the Initial Condition**\n\nAt $ t = 0 $, $ S(0) = 3 $:\n\n$$\n3 = 2 + C \\Rightarrow C = 1\n$$\n\nSo the solution is:\n\n$$\nS(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04t}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluate at $ t = 100 $**\n\n$$\nS(100) = 2 + e^{-0.04 \\cdot 100} = 2 + e^{-4}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2 + e^{-4}}\n$$\n\nThis corresponds to **Option I**.\n\nFinal answer: **I**",

So, the rate out is (S(t)/100) * 4 = (4/100) S(t) = 0.04 S(t) grams per minute.\n\nTherefore, the differential equation is:\n\ndS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t)\n\nThis is a linear first-order differential equation.

So integrating both sides:\n\n∫ d/dt [S(t) e^(0.04t)] dt = ∫ 0.08 e^(0.04t) dt\n\nIntegrating the right side:\n\nLet me compute the integral of 0.08 e^(0.04t) dt. Let u = 0.04t, then du = 0.04 dt, so dt = du/0.04. Therefore, the integral becomes 0.08 ∫ e^u * (du/0.04) = (0.08 / 0.04) ∫ e^u du = 2 e^u + C = 2 e^(0.04t) + C.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nS(t) e^(0.04t) = 2 e^(0.04t) + C\n\nDivide both sides by e^(0.04t):\n\nS(t) = 2 + C e^(-0.04t)\n\nNow apply the initial condition.
