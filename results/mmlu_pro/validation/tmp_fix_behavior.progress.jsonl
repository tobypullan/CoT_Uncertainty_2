What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?", "options": ["-5", "0", "-3", "-7", "-4", "-6", "-1", "-2", "-9", "N/A"], "gold_answer": "E", "baseline_cot_response_raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the greatest negative number in the set B, which consists of all m + n where (m, n) are integer solutions to the equation 7m + 12n = 22. The options are from A to J, with various negative numbers and N/A.\n\nFirst, I need to find all integer solutions (m, n) to the equation 7m + 12n = 22. Then, for each solution, compute m + n and find the greatest negative value among them.\n\nStarting with solving the Diophantine equation 7m + 12n = 22. Since 7 and 12 are coefficients, their greatest common divisor is 1, which divides 22, so there are solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, I can use the method for linear Diophantine equations. First, find one particular solution. Let me try small integers.\n\nLet me try m = 2. Then 7*2 = 14. So 12n = 22 -14 = 8. Then n = 8/12 = 2/3. Not integer. Not good.\n\nTry m = 4. 7*4=28. 28 +12n=22 → 12n= -6 → n= -0.5. Not integer.\n\nm= -2. 7*(-2) = -14. So 12n = 22 +14 = 36 → n=3. So n=3. So (m,n)=(-2,3) is a solution. Let me check: 7*(-2) +12*3 = -14 +36=22. Yes, correct.\n\nSo a particular solution is m0 = -2, n0 = 3.\n\nThe general solution for equations ax + by = c is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)*t\n\ny = y0 - (a/d)*t\n\nwhere d = gcd(a,b). Here, d=1, so:\n\nm = -2 + 12t\n\nn = 3 -7t\n\nfor integer t.\n\nSo all solutions are given by m = -2 +12t, n=3 -7t, where t is any integer.\n\nNow, we need to compute m + n for each solution. Let's compute m + n:\n\nm + n = (-2 +12t) + (3 -7t) = (-2 +3) + (12t -7t) = 1 +5t.\n\nSo B is the set {1 +5t | t ∈ Z}.\n\nBut we need to find the greatest negative number in B. So we need the maximum value of 1 +5t that is negative.\n\nSo 1 +5t < 0 → 5t < -1 → t < -1/5. Since t is integer, this implies t ≤ -1.\n\nWe need the greatest such value. Since 1 +5t increases as t increases, the maximum occurs at the maximum t such that t ≤ -1. So t = -1.\n\nPlugging t=-1: 1 +5*(-1) = 1 -5 = -4.\n\nSo the greatest negative number is -4. Let me check if that's an option. Yes, option E is -4.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if there are other solutions. Because sometimes when you have constraints on m and n (like being integers, but here they are already integers as per the general solution). So for t=-1, m = -2 +12*(-1) = -2 -12 = -14, n=3 -7*(-1)=3 +7=10. Then m +n = -14 +10 = -4. Correct.\n\nIs there a possibility of another t where 1 +5t is negative but greater than -4? Let's see. For t=0: 1 +0=1>0. So not negative. For t=-1 gives -4. For t=-2: 1 +5*(-2)=1-10=-9. Which is more negative. So -4 is the greatest negative. So the answer is E. -4.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are other particular solutions. Suppose I found another particular solution. Let me check another m. For example, let me try m=10. 7*10=70. 12n=22-70=-48 → n=-4. So (10,-4). Then m +n=10-4=6. Which is positive. For t, let's see: For this solution, m=10, n=-4. Let's see what t would correspond. From general solution m=-2 +12t. So 10 = -2 +12t → 12t=12 → t=1. Then n=3 -7(1)= -4. Correct. So t=1 gives m +n=1 +5(1)=6. Correct.\n\nAnother check: t=-1 gives m=-14, n=10. m +n=-4. Correct.\n\nIs there a t where m +n is between -4 and 0? For example, -3? Let's see. Suppose 1 +5t = -3 → 5t = -4 → t=-4/5. Not integer. Similarly for -2: 1 +5t=-2 → 5t=-3 → t=-3/5. Not integer. For -1: 5t=-2 → t=-2/5. Not integer. So the only integer t that gives negative m +n is t ≤ -1. The maximum is t=-1, giving -4. So the answer is E. -4.\n\nBut let me check if there are other solutions outside the general solution? No, because the general solution for linear Diophantine equations includes all solutions.
