The rate of change of salt in the tank is given by the difference between the rate at which salt enters the tank and the rate at which it leaves.\n\n1. **Rate in**: The incoming solution has a concentration of 0.02 grams per liter and flows in at 4 liters per minute. So, the rate of salt entering the tank is:\n   $$\n   \\text{Rate in} = 0.02 \\, \\text{g/L} \\times 4 \\, \\text{L/min} = 0.08 \\, \\text{g/min}\n   $$\n\n2. **Rate out**: The solution is well-mixed, so the concentration of salt in the tank at time $ t $ is $ \\frac{S(t)}{100} $ grams per liter (since the volume remains constant at 100 liters). The outflow rate is 4 liters per minute, so the rate of salt leaving the tank is:\n   $$\n   \\text{Rate out} = \\frac{S(t)}{100} \\, \\text{g/L} \\times 4 \\, \\text{L/min} = \\frac{4S(t)}{100} = 0.04S(t) \\, \\text{g/min}\n   $$\n\n3. **Differential equation**: The rate of change of salt in the tank is:\n   $$\n   \\frac{dS}{dt} = 0.08 - 0.04S(t)\n   $$\n\n4. **Solve the differential equation**: This is a first-order linear differential equation. We can solve it using an integrating factor. The equation is:\n   $$\n   \\frac{dS}{dt} + 0.04S = 0.08\n   $$\n   The integrating factor is $ e^{\\int 0.04 \\, dt} = e^{0.04t} $. Multiply both sides by the integrating factor:\n   $$\n   e^{0.04t} \\frac{dS}{dt} + 0",
